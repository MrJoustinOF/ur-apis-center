# ur-apis-center

This is a backend project built in node.js, which I use in a few projects

## Why many apis in only one project?

This project use heroku as production host, heroku allows to publish just 5 projects for each account, I have already used it in other projects that you can see here in Github

## Projects using this api

- [My Portfolio](https://github.com/MrJoustinOF/portfolioReact)
- [urResourcesNetwork](https://github.com/MrJoustinOF/urrn)
